Cross-platform mobile applications developed in Xamarin.
The project includes 2 applications - a customer and a customer support application.
The project's scope was to help the marketing and improve the customer's user experience and customer support.

The customer application includes features like searching for products by scanning QR code, Support chat, 3D model rendering, etc.

The support application is made for the customer support employees. The application currently has only 
chat functionalities - answer chat session, close chat session, send chat copies.

The project was developed as my bachelor thesis project.
